## Ingredients
* Butter
* Mayo

Add ***3 tablespoons*** of butter onto your skillet and have heat on medium low and allow butter to melt.

### 2. Spread The Mayo 

Next, we will be speading a small scoop of mayo on ***both sides of each bread slice.***


### 3. Toasted Bread 🍞

Now, we add both bread slices to the skillet and leave pan on **low medium heat** and allow the bread slices to toast on both sides but, **DO NOT** burn. We dont like burnt bread for this sandwich, it will ruin it!

### 4. **We Add The Cheese!!! 🧀**

Finally, we add the best part! Now we add all three of our cheeses on top of the toasted bread while on the skillet. Add how many ever slices of cheese you want, the cheesier, the better! 😃 Once the cheese is slightly melted on on of the bread slices, place the other slice of the bread on top of the cheesy bread slice and flip the sandwich over together!
